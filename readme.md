## Introduction
The goal of GravityLab is to realistically render black holes, experience them in real-time and be able to do synthetic experiments to learn General Relativity.

This means the physics used to render images is correct and photon geodesics are properly ray-traced using a black hole metric (Schwarzschild as of this moment). The rendering needs to be optimized so that it runs real-time in a browser and VR headset (at this momoment it runs in real-time on a quest 3 using shaders in WebGL). And one needs to be able to do measurements in the space-time so to assist learning the theory of General Relativity (underconstruction).
